## General Information
This is the vector algebra implementation of reverse image search tool. The vector algebra is used for describing and analyzing data using Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). This project is intended to solve the reverse image search problem using vector algebra contained in a website. The purpose of this project is to fulfill the assignment given by the lecturer's assistants. We undertake this project because this project is mandatory to our final scores.


## Libraries Used
- numpy
- Something else - version 1.0


## Features
Reverse Image Search with:
- CBIR with color parameter
- CBIR with texture parameter


## Screenshots

## Setup

Needs Python (py) in order to run. Python can be found at [their website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). It also needs numpy library, bla bla, and bla bla that are listed in the requirements file. The requirements.txt file is located at the src folder. To automatically installed all of the modules required, simply copy and paste these lines into your terminal.

```shell
cd ./src
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I know when using pip, itâ€™s good practice to use a virtual environment, but I don't care right now. So, happy developing :D


## Usage

There are no additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, just save it, then run it.

```shell
cd ./src
python main.py
```

Here, python just runs the code locally. If you want to use the web version, it's coming soon.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_.
